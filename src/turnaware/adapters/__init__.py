"""TurnAware adapter tier.

Adapters translate a host surface's message shape into a TurnAware admission
request, call the callable core, and route the verdict back into the host's
action model. They depend on the core; the core never depends on them.

Currently shipped:

- `channel` — channel-local transcript surface: trigger + recent transcript +
  agent identity -> verdict -> run-shape action. The contract is
  transport-neutral (branch on `silent`/`verdict`); cc-connect is supported as
  one transport via an opt-in sentinel, not a dependency.
