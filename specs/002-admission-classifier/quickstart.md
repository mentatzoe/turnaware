# Quickstart: Admission Classifier Completion

These commands are the intended verification evidence for the TUR-11 slice once tasks are implemented.

## 1. Install from a clean environment

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install .
turnaware --help
```

## 2. Run deterministic fixture tests

```sh
python -m unittest
```

Expected coverage includes:
- representative PASS, ACK, ASK, SPEAK;
- false ACK guard for `comment back with results` assignment text;
- false PASS guard for resolved-looking trigger plus contradictory missing-work context;
- invalid classifier configuration with no silent fallback;
- CLI/core contract equivalence.

## 3. Verify selected classifier identity in CLI output

Product/default path evidence:

```sh
turnaware admit --input tests/fixtures/speak.json
```

Deterministic evidence path:

```sh
turnaware admit --classifier deterministic --input tests/fixtures/speak.json
```

Expected result shape:
- JSON stdout;
- exit 0 when the selected path is configured and available;
- `classifier` identifies the product/default path for the first command and `deterministic` for the second;
- `verdict` is one of PASS/ACK/ASK/SPEAK;
- no reply/draft/message prose fields.

If the product/default path is not configured in the test environment, the first command must fail clearly and must not silently use `deterministic`.

## 4. Verify known false ACK case

```sh
turnaware admit --classifier deterministic --input tests/fixtures/false_ack_comment_back.json
```

Expected:
- verdict is `SPEAK`, not `ACK`;
- reasons explain substantive assignment/work, not visible acknowledgement;
- context evidence names inspected assignment material truthfully.

## 5. Verify known false PASS case

```sh
turnaware admit --classifier deterministic --input tests/fixtures/false_pass_contradicted_done.json
```

Expected:
- verdict is not `PASS`;
- contradictory missing-work/evidence context is present in `context_checked` or equivalent audit evidence;
- confidence/reasons reflect conflict rather than high-confidence fake done.

## 6. Verify invalid classifier failure

```sh
turnaware admit --classifier does-not-exist --input tests/fixtures/speak.json
```

Expected:
- non-zero exit;
- clear stderr error;
- no successful admission result;
- no silent fallback to deterministic/default classifier.
