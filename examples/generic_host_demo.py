"""Demo: a NON-cc-connect host adopting the gate via the transport-neutral contract.

This stands in for a plain message-queue / "Slack-style" loop — no cc-connect, no
Discord, no platform glue. A worker `helpbot` pulls events off a queue and, for
each one, asks the gate whether to speak BEFORE composing anything. It acts only
on the transport-neutral decision the adapter returns:

    if result.silent:  the host posts nothing
    else:              the host would compose exactly one turn in result.run_shape

It never composes reply prose — it just shows the routing a real host would do.
To prove the contract is platform-agnostic, it also derives this host's OWN
suppression sentinel via ``result.silent_token("<<HOST_NOOP>>")`` — a made-up
magic string for a transport that suppresses sends by a final-output marker.
Nothing here references cc-connect's sentinel.

Run live (real classifier):
    export TURNAWARE_CLASSIFIER_MODEL=google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite
    export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/generic_host_demo.py

Run offline (pin every verdict, just to see the routing/plumbing):
    export TURNAWARE_CLASSIFIER_TEST_RESULT='{"verdict":"PASS","confidences":{"PASS":1,"ACK":0,"ASK":0,"SPEAK":0},"context_checked":[],"reasons":["dev"]}'
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 examples/generic_host_demo.py

    # Or inject a different pinned verdict to watch it route a SPEAK:
    export TURNAWARE_CLASSIFIER_TEST_RESULT='{"verdict":"SPEAK","confidences":{"PASS":0,"ACK":0,"ASK":0,"SPEAK":1},"context_checked":[],"reasons":["dev"]}'
