# TurnAware

Pre-reply judgment for turn-aware agents.

TurnAware is a portable CLI/library for deciding whether an agent should visibly
participate on an unstructured shared surface before ordinary reply generation.
It returns an auditable admission verdict:

- `PASS` — hard stop; no ordinary visible reply
- `ACK` — brief acknowledgement is warranted
- `ASK` — clarification is warranted
- `SPEAK` — substantive contribution is warranted

## Status

The current classifier slice exposes a product/default admission classifier path
backed by a configured provider/model. Successful results include the selected
classifier identity, provider/model audit fields, verdict, confidence
distribution, checked context, and reasons. There is no public `deterministic`
classifier path; offline/CI evidence uses a test fixture provider behind the
product path.

Downstream adapters, live Discord/cc-connect integration, central orchestration,
broad benchmarks, launch claims, and reply composition remain out of scope for
this slice.

## Quickstart

Evaluate a request from stdin through the product/default classifier:

```sh
export TURNAWARE_CLASSIFIER_MODEL="your/provider-model"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m turnaware admit < tests/fixtures/speak.json
```

Evaluate a request from a file through the product classifier:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m turnaware admit --input tests/fixtures/pass.json
```

Evaluate with classifier selection in the envelope, or override it from the CLI:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m turnaware admit --input tests/fixtures/speak_with_classifier.json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m turnaware admit --classifier product --input tests/fixtures/speak_cli_precedence.json
```

Run the verification suite:

```sh
python3 -m unittest
```

## Product contract

The core output contract is:

- `classifier`
- `classifier_provider`
- `classifier_model`
- `verdict`
- `confidences`
- `context_checked`
- `reasons`

Successful CLI evaluations write one JSON object to stdout and exit `0`.
Failures write diagnostics to stderr and do not emit a success verdict on
stdout.

Exit codes:

- `0` — successful evaluation
- `1` — unexpected runtime failure
- `2` — input source or JSON parse failure
- `3` — admission request validation failure

TurnAware owns admission, not composition. It does not draft the final reply and
it does not prescribe speech shape beyond the admission verdict.

## Classifier selection

The documented default classifier path is `product`. It is the only supported
classifier path in this slice and is backed by a configured OpenAI-compatible
provider/model. It is not a relabelled local keyword or deterministic verifier.
If provider/model configuration is unavailable, TurnAware fails clearly instead
of silently falling back to local logic.

Classifier selection can be supplied by:

- envelope field: `"classifier": "product"`
- CLI flag: `--classifier product`

If both are present, the CLI flag takes precedence. Optional
`classifier_config` / `--classifier-config` must be a JSON object. Supported
product configuration keys are `provider`, `model`, and `timeout`. Unsupported
classifier names or config keys fail clearly without emitting a success result.

The provider endpoint and API key are operator-only and are never read from
`classifier_config`: because a request envelope carries `classifier_config`, an
untrusted request must not be able to redirect the provider call (which carries
the operator's API key) or choose which environment variable the key is read
from. These are resolved exclusively from operator environment variables:

- `TURNAWARE_CLASSIFIER_MODEL` for the model name (or `classifier_config.model`).
- `TURNAWARE_CLASSIFIER_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for the API key.
- `TURNAWARE_CLASSIFIER_BASE_URL` or `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for the compatible API
  base URL; default is `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`.

The test suite sets a fixture provider response for deterministic offline
verification. That fixture provider is not a selectable classifier path.

## Python API

The in-process core is available without shelling out:

```python
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("src"))

from turnaware import evaluate

os.environ["TURNAWARE_CLASSIFIER_MODEL"] = "your/provider-model"
os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"] = "..."

result = evaluate({
    "trigger": {"content": "turnaware-vigil, please implement the CLI MVP."},
    "context": [],
})
```

`result["classifier"]` identifies the selected path, `result["classifier_model"]`
identifies the provider model, and `result["verdict"]` is one of `PASS`, `ACK`,
`ASK`, or `SPEAK`.

## Verdict test suite

The classifier verdict test suite is the merge contract for classifier
changes: a fixture corpus of observed and predicted failure modes
(Multica-shaped agent traffic, Discord-shaped human conversation, and
verdict-surface contract cases) run through a pluggable adapter against any
classifier candidate. The single entry command is
`python3 specs/003-classifier-test-suite/contracts/runner.py`; see
[specs/003-classifier-test-suite/quickstart.md](specs/003-classifier-test-suite/quickstart.md)
for the offline deterministic path, live evidence runs, and how to add a
fixture.

## Development method

This repository uses Spec Kit. The constitution at
`.specify/memory/constitution.md` is the source of governance for all specs,
plans, tasks, implementation, documentation, and release claims.

For production work, use:

```text
constitution -> specify -> clarify -> plan -> checklist -> tasks -> analyze -> implement
```

A product spec should prove an end-to-end runnable path from supplied
conversation context to a verdict a harness can obey.
